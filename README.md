# Customer Churn Prediction 📊 

## Overview 📌
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service. Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take preventive actions. 
Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market. Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. 

## Objectives 📌
* Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.
* Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn
* Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.

## Dataset 📂
[Telco Custpmer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction/data)

### The data set includes information about:
* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
*

## Results 📊
The performance of the models is evaluated based on classification metrics. A detailed report of model performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance, is generated after training.

🔮 Future Enhancements

🚀 Additional Models: Implement XGBoost, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods.

🌐 Deployment: Serve the model using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.

 Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time predictions and insights.

📡 Automated Feature Engineering: Enhance preprocessing with feature selection techniques.
