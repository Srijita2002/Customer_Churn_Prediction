#📊 Customer Churn Prediction

##📌 Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take preventive actions. This project utilizes machine learning models like Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict customer churn based on historical data. The goal is to help businesses retain customers by providing insights into factors influencing churn and enabling proactive engagement strategies.

##🚀 Features

📌 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, correlations, and distributions in customer data.

🤖 Model Training: Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for predicting customer churn.

📈 Performance Evaluation: Assessing models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models for improved performance.

📊 Model Interpretability: Analyzing feature importance and decision rules.


📂 Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains customer information, including:

🏠 Demographics: Age, gender, location, etc.

📞 Account Details: Subscription type, tenure, contract details.

💳 Transaction Data: Payment history, billing method.

📡 Service Usage: Internet, phone usage, complaints, support interactions.

You can use any publicly available churn dataset or your proprietary data.


📊 Results

The performance of the models is evaluated based on classification metrics. A detailed report of model performance, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance, is generated after training.

🔮 Future Enhancements

🚀 Additional Models: Implement XGBoost, Neural Networks, and ensemble methods.

🌐 Deployment: Serve the model using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.

📊 Dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time predictions and insights.

📡 Automated Feature Engineering: Enhance preprocessing with feature selection techniques.
